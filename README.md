## Overview
Chemistry Gas Simulation - Demonstration type simulation remodeled from a phet colorado online simulation where thereâ€™s many factors like temperature, pressure, volume, and number of moles affecting how the colored particles behave according to the ideal gas law PV = nRT. The particles at hand will be ideal gases in group 18, such as helium and neon. Not only are they closest to ideal gases in real life having almost no intermolecular forces due to being nonpolar and monoatomic, them being unreactive too eliminates the obligation to incorporate reactions in a simulation meant to demonstrate gas behavior. The particles will collide with the wall as well as with each other at different velocities. The particles and the wall are assumed to be smooth, rigid, and 100% elastic due to the ideal gas law neglecting intermolecular forces as well as loss of energy between collisions. Gravity is ignored and kinetic energy and momentum is conserved. The amount of collisions as well as the impulse carried with each collision against the wall specifically will determine the pressure of the system. Hence its definition, temperature will be equal to the average kinetic energy of all the particles in the system. Volume will be equal to the size of the container solely, since the ideal gas law assumes the volume of the particles themselves is negligible. Users will be able to change these different factors and see the change in gas behavior. There will be a menu where you can keep specific factors constant, and see how other factors will change to accommodate that change.

## Instructions
1. Pressing play button will bring you to simulation screen, nothing is happening at this point
2. Top left corner will have the statistics and numbers for any changes that might affect the movement of the particles and top right corner displays the PV = nRT equation and how it changes throughout the simulation
3. To start the simulation, press the arrow keys under the box that says particles. This will spawn gas particles into the container and numbers will start changing. You are able to add and remove particles here and there is three kidns of particles to add/remove
4. To change the volume and see how it affects the simulation, there is a light blue box on the right of the container, dragging it left and right will change the volume. 
5. There is a grey piece on the top left of the container. This is the lid, dragging it left and right will create a gap in the container that lets gas particles escape into the surroundings(container is the system). 
6. To manually change the temperature, dragging the slider on the bucket up to heat will increase the temperature, dragging the slider on the bucket down to cool will decrease the temperature (you can check the thermometer reading if the temperature changes) as well as see graphics
7. The Hold Constant grey box will change what is being held constant in the simulation and pressing any of the circles that correspond to the word next to it will keep that factor constant. If the circle turns blue, you will know if you clicked it
8. There is a play and pause button to stop and start the simulation at any time.
9. There is a reset orange button to restart the simulation and clear the container. 
10. There is a fast forward button that zooms up the simulation. 
11. Have fun and learn about how volume, temperature, moles of particles, and pressure change how gas particles move according to the ideal gas law!!
